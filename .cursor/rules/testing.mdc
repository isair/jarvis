# Testing guidelines

Tests should focus on observable outcomes and behaviors, not internal implementation details.

Treat the system as a black box: verify that inputs produce the correct outputs and side effects, regardless of how the result is achieved.

Write tests that are reliable, isolated, and easy to understand.
