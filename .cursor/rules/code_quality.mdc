# Code quality standards

Write code that is clear, maintainable, and easy to understand.

Prioritize readability and simplicity over cleverness.

The best code is the least amount of code possible.

Always document complex logic and follow established style guides to ensure consistency across the codebase.

No need to keep old parameters or logic for backwards compatibility.

Every new piece of code should have tests that cover its functionality.

Do not add comments or documentation mentioning something is different than before. Comments and documentation should always be about the current state of the code.
