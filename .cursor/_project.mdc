# Project Specific Rules

Data privacy comes first, always.

## Architecture Decisions

### Tool-Profile Separation of Concerns

**Decision**: Separate "when/how to use tools" from "what to do after tools execute" into distinct layers.

**Implementation**:
- **Tool Descriptions** (`src/jarvis/tools.py`): Specify when and how tools should be used
  - LOG_MEAL: "when the user mentions eating or drinking something specific"
  - FETCH_MEALS: "when the user asks about their eating history"
  - Include clear examples and usage patterns

- **Profile System Prompts** (`src/jarvis/profiles.py`): Focus on post-tool behavior and personality
  - Life profile: "After logging meals: Follow up with healthy suggestions..."
  - Life profile: "After fetching meal history: Provide a brief recap with recommendations..."
