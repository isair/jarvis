# Project Specific Rules

Data privacy comes first, always.

## Architecture Decisions

### Language-Agnostic Design

Avoid hardcoded language patterns as this assistant needs to support an arbitrary amount of different languages.

### Tool-Profile Separation

Tools define when/how to be used. Profiles define what to do after tools execute. Keep these concerns separate in `tools.py` and `profiles.py`.

### Tool Response Flow

Tools return raw data without LLM processing. Profiles handle all response formatting and personality through the daemon's LLM loop. This ensures consistent response style across all profiles.
