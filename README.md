Perfect timing! Found several stories that match your interests. OpenAI just announced a major partnership with Google for enterprise AI infrastructure - interesting given your previous questions about AI consolidation. Also, that carbon credit startup we discussed last month, Patch, just closed a $55M Series B. And there's breaking news about the EU's new AI regulation enforcement starting today, which could impact the fintech regulatory landscape you've been tracking. The renewable energy markets you asked about last week are also moving - solar futures hit record highs after Germany's new subsidy announcement. Want me to dive deeper into any of these?

Looking at your week - you mentioned wanting to lose 10 pounds by March and you've been doing really well! Today you've had overnight oats (320 cal), a salad with grilled chicken (380 cal), and some almonds (160 cal) - about 860 calories so far.

Given your 1,800 calorie target and that you hit the gym yesterday, you've got room for pizza! But maybe consider:
- Split a medium pizza instead of ordering a large
- Add a side salad to get some extra nutrients  
- Go for thin crust vs deep dish to save ~200 calories per slice

You've been consistent with your goals this week (I see you logged workouts Monday, Tuesday, and yesterday), so don't stress about one pizza night. Balance is key!

I can see the error on your screen - looks like a "Cannot return null for non-nullable field User.email" error. Based on your previous GraphQL work and what I'm seeing:

**The Issue**: Your User type has `email: String!` (non-nullable) but the resolver is returning null, probably from the database.

**Quick fixes to try**:

1. **Check your resolver** - the getUserById function likely has a user record where email is null/undefined
2. **Database query** - run `SELECT email FROM users WHERE email IS NULL` to confirm
3. **Schema fix** - if emails can be null, change your schema to `email: String` (nullable)

I remember you mentioned last week that you were migrating user data - this could be from incomplete migration where some users don't have emails set yet.

**Immediate fix**: Add a null check in your resolver:
`email: user.email || "pending@example.com"`

Want me to help you run a database query to check for null emails, or would you prefer to update the schema first?

## Quick Install (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Ollama
Download from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)

### 2. Get the AI model
```bash
ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
```

### 3. Install Jarvis

**Mac:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isair/jarvis.git
cd jarvis
bash scripts/run_macos.sh
```

**Windows (Recommended - with Micromamba):**
```powershell
# First install Micromamba (avoids build issues)
Invoke-Expression ((Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://micro.mamba.pm/install.ps1).Content)

# Then install Jarvis
git clone https://github.com/isair/jarvis.git
cd jarvis
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\run_windows.ps1
```

**Windows (Alternative - requires build tools):**
```powershell
# Install Visual C++ Build Tools first from:
# https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
# (Select "Desktop development with C++" workload)

git clone https://github.com/isair/jarvis.git
cd jarvis
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\run_windows.ps1
```

**Linux:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isair/jarvis.git
cd jarvis
bash scripts/run_linux.sh
```

Done! Say "Jarvis" and start talking.

## Configuration

Most users won't need to change anything. For advanced options, see the [config example](examples/config.json).

### High-Quality AI Voice (Chatterbox TTS)

Enable experimental AI-powered text-to-speech with emotion and voice cloning:

```json
{
  "tts_engine": "chatterbox"
}
```

**Voice Cloning:**
1. Record a 3-10 second clear voice sample (save as .wav)
2. Add to your config:
```json
{
  "tts_engine": "chatterbox",
  "tts_chatterbox_audio_prompt": "/path/to/voice_sample.wav"
}
```

**Fine-tuning voice:**
- `tts_chatterbox_exaggeration`: 0.0-1.0+ (emotion intensity, default 0.5)
- `tts_chatterbox_cfg_weight`: 0.0-1.0 (quality vs speed, default 0.5)

### External Tool Integration (MCP)

Connect Jarvis to any tool using MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers:

**Example - VSCode integration:**
```json
{
  "mcps": {
    "vscode": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@niwang/mcp-server-vscode"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Example - Multiple tools:**
```json
{
  "mcps": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/yourname/documents"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Jarvis doesn't hear me**
- Check microphone permissions
- Speak clearly after saying "Jarvis"

**Responses are slow**
- Switch to smaller model: `ollama pull llama3:8b`
- Add to config: `{"ollama_chat_model": "llama3:8b"}`

**Windows build errors**
- Use the Micromamba installation method (recommended)
- Or install [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
